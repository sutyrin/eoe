# Matrix Sim — "Fixed Matrix" World Simulation

## Intent
Interactive simulation of a systemically repaired Matrix world from a worldbuilding analysis dialogue. Core idea: humans as distributed processors (not batteries), Zion as a pressure valve, Neo as statistical inevitability.

## Model
- Stress slider controls productivity AND awakening rate (Gaussian optimum ~60)
- Too low stress → brains idle, low compute output
- Too high stress → mass awakenings, anomalies cascade
- Zion ON → anomalies drain safely, system stabilizes
- Zion OFF → anomalies accumulate, cascade failure
- Neo event → statistical inevitability at high population × time

## Feedback loops
- Stress ↑ → productivity ↑ → but awakenings ↑
- Awakenings ↑ → anomalies ↑ → instability ↑
- Zion ON → anomalies drain → stability ↑ → but compute ↓
- Zion OFF → anomalies accumulate → cascade
