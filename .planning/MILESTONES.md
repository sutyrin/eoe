# Project Milestones: Engines of Experience

## v1.0 MVP (Shipped: 2026-01-30)

**Delivered:** Complete creation-to-distribution pipeline — from creative code sketches to video capture, encoding, and platform publishing.

**Phases completed:** 1-3 (10 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- **Visual atoms foundation** — p5.js sketches with Vite hot-reload, lil-gui parameter tuning, and Astro portfolio site
- **Audio synthesis** — Tone.js integration with synth factories, effects chains, disposal patterns, and audio-reactive compositions
- **Audio-visual atoms** — Combined visual + audio atoms with transport synchronization and timeline orchestration
- **Video capture pipeline** — Playwright headless browser automation with MediaRecorder canvas+audio capture to WebM VP9+Opus
- **Video encoding** — FFmpeg transcoding for YouTube 16:9 and TikTok 9:16 with aspect ratio preservation and H.264/AAC compatibility
- **Publishing pipeline** — OAuth2 authentication (YouTube browser flow), video upload with resumable uploads, credential storage, and NOTES.md URL tracking

**Stats:**

- 3 phases, 10 plans, ~30 execution tasks
- 16 files created/modified, 618 insertions
- 41 days from project init (2025-12-20) to ship (2026-01-30)
- Tech stack: Vite 7, p5.js, Tone.js 15, Playwright 1.5, FFmpeg, googleapis, Astro

**Git range:** feat(01-01) — feat(03-03) + Quick Tasks 001-008 (bug fixes, audio capture refinement)

**What's next:**

v2 features (batch publishing, automation, streaming, community) deferred pending production use and pain point observation. Phase 1 quota of 20+ visual atoms drives creation velocity validation.
