# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-30
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 10 (3 phases × 3 plans + research summary)

## Overview

This roadmap delivered a creative practice and publishing ecosystem in 3 phases, prioritizing depth before breadth and manual workflows before automation. Phase 1 establishes the vertical (visual creative coding) with foundational tooling. Phase 2 adds the first horizontal (audio) to enable cross-domain composition. Phase 3 completes the distribution pipeline with video capture and CLI tooling maturity.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation - Visual Atoms & Portfolio

**Goal:** Users can create p5.js sketches in short bursts, see them live in a portfolio, and track creative progress.

**Plans:** 4 plans (all complete)

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Monorepo skeleton with npm workspaces, Vite, Git LFS, shared configs
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — CLI tool with create/dev commands and visual atom template
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Astro portfolio site with atom gallery and detail pages
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Note/status CLI commands and dev dashboard

**Requirements:** 12/12 fulfilled
- REPO-01: Single monorepo with atoms, compositions, tools, notes ✓
- REPO-02: Standardized atom directory structure ✓
- REPO-03: Shared tooling config (TypeScript, Vite, linting) ✓
- REPO-04: Git + LFS configured for media assets ✓
- VIS-01: Create p5.js sketches with Vite hot-reload ✓
- VIS-02: Atom template scaffolding ✓
- VIS-03: Standardized atom interface (init, update, draw, cleanup, config) ✓
- VIS-04: Parameter config per atom (colors, speeds, sizes) ✓
- CLI-01: `eoe create <type> <name>` ✓
- CLI-02: `eoe dev <atom>` ✓
- NOTE-01: Markdown-based idea capture ✓
- NOTE-02: Per-atom notes file tracking ✓

---

### Phase 2: Audio Integration

**Goal:** Users can create audio atoms with Tone.js and combine them with visual atoms to produce audio-reactive compositions.

**Dependencies:** Phase 1

**Plans:** 3 plans (all complete)

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Tone.js library with synths, effects, transport, disposal patterns
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Audio-reactive visual analysis (FFT, frequency bins, amplitude)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Composition manager for multi-atom orchestration with timeline

**Requirements:** 12/12 fulfilled
- AUD-01: Create audio atoms with Tone.js ✓
- AUD-02: Simple tune composition (synths, sequences, effects) ✓
- AUD-03: Audio-reactive visual parameters ✓
- AUD-04: Audio atom template scaffolding ✓
- CLI-03: `eoe build <atom>` production bundle ✓
- CLI-05: `eoe list` shows all atoms with status ✓
- NOTE-03: WIP tracker showing all pieces and stage ✓
- NOTE-04: CLI integration (`eoe note`, `eoe status`) ✓
- Plus composition requirements for multi-atom orchestration (4 additional)

### Phase 3: Video Capture & Distribution

**Goal:** Users can capture running atoms as video, encode for multiple platforms, and track distribution via enhanced CLI.

**Dependencies:** Phase 2

**Plans:** 3 plans (all complete)

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Video capture pipeline (Playwright + MediaRecorder canvas+audio)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Video encoding (FFmpeg YouTube 16:9 / TikTok 9:16)
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Publishing pipeline (OAuth2 auth, platform upload, NOTES.md tracking)

**Requirements:** 5/5 fulfilled
- VID-01: Capture running atom canvas to video via Playwright ✓
- VID-02: FFmpeg encoding to platform formats (16:9 YouTube, 9:16 TikTok) ✓
- VID-03: Thumbnail extraction from key frames ✓
- VID-04: Capture with audio (record Tone.js output alongside visuals) ✓
- CLI-04: `eoe capture <atom>` records canvas to video ✓
- Plus publishing requirements for auth + platform upload (2 additional)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 3 phases (not 7) | Standard depth guidance + MVP focus | Preserved focus on core workflow, deferred v2 features (automation, streaming, community) |
| Visual atoms before audio | Lower complexity, faster validation | Enabled quick Phase 1 completion with 20+ sketch quota enforcement |
| Manual publishing in Phase 3 | "Start manual, automate pain points" | Discovered YouTube-only focus (TikTok too complex for v1) |
| p5.js instance mode for atoms | Enables multiple sketches, HMR cleanup | Avoided global namespace pollution, enables safe composition |
| Tone.js v15.1.22 | Proven Transport scheduling, Web Audio API abstraction | Reliable audio synthesis with memory leak prevention patterns |
| Global exposure of AudioContext | Enable headless capture scripts | window.__TONE_CONTEXT__ + __TONE_DESTINATION__ solve module scope issue |
| MediaStreamDestination for audio routing | Web Audio API node creates MediaStream | Tone.js output now captures to WebM with Opus audio track |
| Playwright headless browser | Mature automation, GPU support, reliable cleanup | Canvas rendering + MediaRecorder API work perfectly in headless mode |
| ffmpeg-static bundled binary | Eliminates system dependency | Consistent FFmpeg version, easier deployment |
| File-based credentials | Simple, portable, no database | ~/.eoe/credentials.json with chmod 600 for security |

---

## Issues Resolved

- Audio capture in headless browser (initially silent, solved via Web Audio API routing)
- Audio-visual sync timing (Tone.js transport + MediaRecorder frame correlation)
- Canvas resolution in headless vs headed rendering
- Aspect ratio preservation during encoding (scale+pad vs crop)
- Shell completion for new commands (added digit parsing, atom list caching)

---

## Technical Debt

None identified. Phase 3 complete, all requirements fulfilled, audio/video pipelines validated.
